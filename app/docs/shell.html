        <h1>Snug Shell</h1>
        <pre>
The snug shell is the primary shell of the snug eco and operating system.
It prompts the user for input, which it then parses by words.
The first word is the name of the executable to run.
Executables are given the prefix 'bin.' and then searched for in the file system.
All trailing words are parameters, which are passed to the executable program
through the 'args' file.
        </pre>

        <h3>Argument Format</h3>
        <pre>
Argument are written into the 'args' file as blocks in sequential order,
prefix by a two byte header. The first byte is a flag 
which indicates the status of the following block:
    0x00 - End of argument stream
    0x01 - Argument not read
    0x02 - Argument read (ignore on search pass)
The second byte contains the length of the following argument string.
        </pre>

        <h3>Argument Reading</h3>
        <pre>
When reading an argument from the 'args' file, 
the reader walks over block, keeping track of the start of the next block.
Whenever the start of a block is reached, it is either ignored if already read, or returned.
Upon hitting the end of argument stream an error is returned, usually in the form of a null pointer.
