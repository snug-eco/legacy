        <h1>Text Files</h1>
        <pre>
Text files are zero'd out by default,
as are all other files. Thus, their
content length is determined by null
termination.

file extensions:
- "s" assembler source files

file prefixes (root directories):
- "bin" binary executables
- "app" application source files
- "lib" standard library source files
- "usr" user source files
        </pre>
